Je cours acheter les pilules mais je ne me souviens pas du moment de l’achat. Ensuite, je reviens avec des pilules, mais la femme est déjà morte. J'entends une sirène de voiture, je tourne la tête mais il n'y a pas de voiture. Retour en arrière. Tout est exactement pareil : la situation, la femme, la couverture ... Mais elle est de nouveau en vie, et me demande d'aller à la pharmacie. Je cours à nouveau à la pharmacie en réalisant qu'elle va mourir. Alors je reviens; et elle est morte.",

Le palier est très étroit et long, avec des boîtes aux lettres accrochées le long du mur. Je mets les clés dans une des boîtes aux lettres et je descends au premier étage. Je suis sorti et j'entends une voix dans ma tête. - Aujourd'hui, un convoi transportant 2 objets a traversé la ville, vous les avez volés, et maintenant vous devez vous cacher... Soyez prudent, ils sont à vos trousses. Soudain, je vois une personne étrange, ce n'est pas une personne, c'est la silhouette d'une personne, constituée de parasite de télévision. Encore une voix étrange dans ma tête. - C'est une voix d'homme. Il te cherche. Cours... Cours à travers les jardins. Étrange, mais pour une raison indéfinie, il n'y a personne autour de moi.

I take one of the items taken in the apartment from the table from my pocket and throw it on the ground in front of me. The subject flew into the air, began to stretch out and turned into some kind of long thick worm, painted in a rainbow. The worm curled up into an eight and this eight just rotates in the air. And again this voice .. - Ultimatum of pain ... Now the eyes of the whole world will be riveted to this place. Run! I'm running back to the apartment. Check if the keys are in place. All this time I’m very nervous about the feeling of persecution. What should I do? I run out into the street. Dark. Some strange darkness that appeared in the middle of the day ...",

No, no people, no cars, no cats, no dogs, from the surrounding sounds only the shuffling sound of my boots. Behind someone called me by name.

On the very edge of the well squatting people in dark clothes, with hoods on their heads. Look down. One of them turns in my direction and heartily shouts that there is strength. - One shot himself !!! And immediately jumps down. Others sitting on the edge begin to jump down.

A teacher walks nearby and I hesitate to get up from my seat. Then I think about the need to fly. I’m on the plane, I find the seat belt on the left, I look at the seat on which I am sitting, it is black leather, glistens, I run it over with my hand. Then I say to the person sitting next to me so that he does not disturb me, now I will sleep.",

They begin to ask me why there was a fire. I answer that no one set fire to it, it caught fire, the workers think that this is quite likely. The action goes inside the premises where employees work. One tells the other that he built a partition between them, because he is embarrassed to work when everyone is watching. On the monitor from the surveillance camera you can see someone moving off the roof of the gas station - the set descent flies a little and crashes into the asphalt.

They said that for the last 3 months have been doing hit and runs to save as many people as they can but that the virus hit so hard and fast that there was no way to deploy in time to save everyone.

There was a lake, there was a road nearby, along the edges of which poplars grew. The mountains were a couple of kilometers from this place. I see how men saw these poplars and knock right on the road. I can’t understand where I am. I go further down the road, I find houses and streets, I remember that this place is in West Point. I call my father to pick me up. I go to some store, and when I go out, there are completely different houses and streets in front of me What city am I in? It becomes anxious and uncomfortable at all.

I open the cabinet doors, see that the water hasn’t reached it yet, the books are dry. I remembered that I was without clothes. I immediately found a blue shirt, but somehow very narrow and I can’t find the bottom of the T-shirt. ”Grandmother, grandfather, his sister and some young woman appear at the door of the apartment a woman with a big belly (pregnant). They came in, I was glad that my grandfather walks and talks well. They all proceeded to the kitchen, and I went to another room to finally find the shorts. Mom, as it turned out, was already standing there looking for them. But everything is in vain, they are in no way at all. A pregnant girl came up and complained that the music was playing too loud. I went to the kitchen to fix it. Everyone is sitting at the table in the kitchen. A strange feeling that there are a lot of people ... But I can’t remember anyone people are strangers to me.

We are running out of strength, we have been in the cell for a long time. And now after another attempt a heavy iron door opened. I dare to look through the barred window and see that a group of ghost soldiers is rapidly advancing towards the building. They look terrifying - faceless black phantoms from which darkness spreads. I look back into the camera, but the people with me who were in it are gone , they are already walking further along the corridor, hoping to leave this damned place.

I dive into the water and feel that I can not come up. I stick my hands out of the water freely, and my head seems to rest against an invisible ceiling, but it doesn’t bother me, I breathe freely underwater.In the pond itself, there is very clear and fresh water, and a lot of fish swim ... I decide to dive deeper and I’ll regret it right there, some unknown force pulling me in. It was getting darker and it’s colder.

No wonder, we have one or two plastic humanoids invented to kill the living. We miraculously survive in a fight with one of them I’m hiding. Suddenly someone grabs my hand and drags me to the balcony. It turned out to be some kind of elf. I open a pack of cigarettes and, struggling with wild stress, take a drag. Suddenly the phone rings. Quiet !!! The robot will hear! There’s a female a voice in an unknown language tells me something important, but I don’t understand ... I know that before I ended up in an unlucky apartment, I met some Elf. I become an unexpectedly valuable shot of national importance. The Elf has already self-destructed through the hole between the sofa and the wall. They are leading me into the kitchen. I look around, the robots are not asleep, and their function is still it’s not done yet. I’m all the time scared, very scared. I’m calming down a bit in the kitchen, as if one of the leaders settled here. I nap at the table and feel the touch. I open my eyes - they carry us out. These are lifeguards! Evacuation is already in full swing on the balcony, we are lined up. Everyone is jumping. Until now, a non-decrypted call from an invisible interlocutor elevated me to the rank of operation target. I stand in the opening, watch others jump, push me behind. I clarify. - Do I jump too ?. I get an affirmative answer and am about to jump down. However, I still do not have a parachute. I joke that it’s already possible for 10 minutes to joyfully fly down just like that. In general, I put on a parachute, I get a command to pull the ring after 10 seconds and jump. I think that no one conducted the briefing ... I pull, I pull, I pull, but not that and not there. Despite the fact that I had to evacuate from the balcony, I see the world below from a bird's eye view. And this world is approaching very quickly, but the parachute is still not opening. I don’t have time to feel the beauty of free fall ... I land in a rice field, knee-deep in muddy water. Everyone who was with me in the apartment is also here, contrary to the laws of physics. While we are waiting for the rest, I intend to visit one of 5-6 wooden booths that are nearby. The first is covered with bleach, and I'm barefoot. In the second, a cat with dead red kittens. In the third, the cat is gray, and the kittens are alive. In other people. I decide to remove the redheads and implement the plan, but the caricature shaking cat has already removed the kittens and freed up the field of activity. I didn’t succeed, because it’s crowded, and the web is on all sides ...",
	
	IGUI_Dream41 = "I am with relatives, visiting an old grandfather whom I don’t know at all, but he is strikingly similar to a man named Tony Beats. We walked around to tell him the garden plot.

I manage to escape, but after a while I find myself in this house again. He is still warm and humid from the fire.

But I can’t get to my sister and save her ... <LINE> <LINE> More I’m already at the cemetery, or rather, at the entrance to the cemetery. Before me, a demon, he came to me - seeks my location.

And the child from the demon’s belly moves to me. He’s already quite an adult - three years old, blue-eyed, dark-haired, with rather long hair. <LINE> <LINE> Day. I am standing in the street in front of some office building. I see a woman who lays on a makeshift counter a wide variety of candles - red, black, yellow, white. I pay special attention to one of the black ones - this is a long twisted candle with some intricate tip that reminded me of a bow. I see that these are not just candles, but some special candles, for magical practices. I go up to this woman to ask where she bought them. And she tells me, pointing to this office building, that over there, upstairs shop. I look there, and there one of the windows is barred, but not with the usual window grill, but small-fine, that is, through which light hardly passes. It seems extremely strange to me. But I am going inside. <LINE> <LINE> As soon as I enter, I realize that I am in a long-abandoned, dilapidated building.

And immediately my gaze goes to the place where the woman stood and sold candles. It is surrounded by some zombies! <LINE> <LINE> I run down the stairs, bypassing this crowd of monsters. In my hands I have two trolleys that should cling to one after another. I understand that I can only escape in one way - clinging to Natasha, who for some reason rides by bicycle. <LINE> <LINE> We broke away and drove to her house. Which is not at all like her current home. But for some reason I’m not with Natasha anymore, but either with Olga, or with someone else. And we understand that all over the world some kind of monster invasion has begun. <LINE> <LINE> We go into the house, and there Natasha goes down the stairs with someone and she is completely indifferent to what is happening. It is very strange, as if she were zombied. We went up to another floor, and began to look at what was happening below, from a window on the landing. And down there, the aliens take everyone who leaves the house. But they do not look like monsters - they were just a crowd of strange people. <LINE> <LINE> And here I am again with Natasha. We decided to try to get out of the house. We go down ... <LINE> <LINE> We lie under some bush. Hid. We see how on the huge screens on the street they broadcast what is happening in the world. First they show some man - politics. One of the main ones. Aliens did something terrible to him. Then they show how all the newborn is now branded - they put a round sign with a strange pattern inside on the right buttock. After that, I understand that I’m just being taken to sleep ... <LINE> <LINE> I wake up from the fact that one of the aliens discovered me. Natasha is not around. Oddly enough, he looks like an ordinary human guy. He leads me somewhere. We go, and I think that, here, a meteorite fell, and aliens came after it. And for me it is logical and real! Following him, I make some kind of table in my head. I think that when I fill it, the dream will end, but I manage to fill in only two fields in the table. <LINE> <LINE> We continue to walk along the street, in front of the restaurant, large round tables in the open. I stopped next to a man. He called me, and the one who led me said nothing. This man from the restaurant gave me a drink of his glass of something bright - it looks like it's champagne. But after drinking, I do not feel the taste. Then he handed me a small glass on his leg. It has a scarlet liquid. It shimmers in different shades. I think this is liquor ... it will be delicious now. The liquid turned out to be of an ugly taste - some kind of bitter-salty, with an incomprehensible aftertaste ... ",

In response, they say that over the past 3 months they have been doing everything possible to save as many people as possible, but the virus infected so quickly that there was no way to save everyone. In shock, I ask if anyone else is left ... After a moment, he tells me that they managed to get the vaccine before the virus spread so far that it could not spread further. But they could not do anything for those already infected. I'm falling from the chair. I am not alone ... Then he says that I look hungry and gives me an army dry sack. I eat it so fast that I almost swallow my tongue. Then they give me a warm cup of coffee, and when I drink, tears flow down my face.

The man gave plasticine robots to all the spectators and they started to chew them, but it turned out that the concert was just a cover, and that all these people were gathered here so that there was an opportunity to climb around their houses, where the funeral is going on. and everywhere in the house, everything is sad, in black, the coffin is standing in. I find a ring in a designated place and climb into a garbage bag, everyone behind me, of course, shouting “How did you get here!?!?, and I'm already on the other end In the end, I collect everything and return the same way to the barge, the lead man suddenly rushes to the wall and destroys everything, I find myself on the shore, along with a huge white elk in a white T-shirt with yellow stripes on the sleeves. The moose is molded of plastic or something similar, and a small toy boat was lying on the back. I walk along the shore, I think where should I go next - this moose is clearly not an adviser. I return to the boat, pick it up, and it turned out to be an exact small copy of that barge. On the wall where the man jumped was a small silhouette carved on a tree. He is full-length and points a finger somewhere. I look where he points his finger. It turned out that in that direction is a residential area and smoke rises from some building. I go to the houses, the moose with me. I go to a four-story building with smoke, I understand that this is a school, it is locked and there is panic. We climb up with the elk along the fire escape to the very top. The roof is on. In the windows I see that the guys at school have a uniform - white tracksuits with yellow stripes. I say moose -Your way out, man, task for you! And he is standing, looking at me. Fashioned from something, even fingerprints remained on it. I think - Fool. I take off his shirt and put it on the window. The moose remained on the street. I go into the room, like a circus arena, round. There is a meeting. Everyone is intimidated, everyone knows something. I jump onto the stage, grab the microphone and start talking. I am entertaining a little, relaxing the audience, I feel this excitement and at the same time I am watching all the spectators, they are in my palm. One strange mikimaus alerted me and a man who looks at me in horror and whispers something. I take him to the stage, give the microphone and make everyone say that he knows. Comforting him. - All of their own and everyone wants to know ... He tells me. - You are the one! Who, I say, is the same ?? Well, the one about which they warned! It turns out that there was a man who visited me and frightened everyone, who set fire to the roof so that everyone would be scared and scatter. Everyone was waiting for me. I recall that even before the concert for the dead they explained to me that there is some kind of man who can destroy everyone if the doors are closed. I need to neutralize it and prevent everything. What does it mean: if the doors are closed, they did not explain to me. I try to calm people and gently grab mycimaus. I rip off a plush costume from him, there was another mycimaus - as if alive, moves, looks at me, rips off this costume from him. There is mycimaus there again, only of smaller stature. A couple more times, and I get to the little battery-powered electric bug. Meanwhile, everything began to crumble. I disassemble the beetle for spare parts and lose a lot of time. I start to withdraw the frightened people, and I see how in the distance, between the schoolchildren in white suits, the same man flashed by who closes the doors. He climbed after me into a garbage bag in one of the houses ... I followed him. ... ... From the found tools, a device was assembled with which you can jump into some kind of kindergarten, in which I am a child, and he is a teacher. He knows that I am in one of the children, but does not know which one. Everything is precisely designed to press it against a wall in a room filled with children's picture books. It turned out as a result of the conversation that he was told that I was an enemy, that everyone next to me was dying when I open the doors, and that he needed to save people from me .. They gathered all the people, put them in the elevator and drove down to where safely. As soon as everyone got out of the bodice and the doors began to close, an old man flew in by helicopter and said that we were great, did the job. I understand that the elevator doors opened with me, and now they will close with him, with a man, and everything will explode. I hold the elevator doors, and the old man in a helicopter laughs.

I started to feel that something was wrong. Maggie's gaze became more intense, and her hands began to caress my breasts. I was in shock and didn't know what to do. Maggie noticed my arousal and began kissing my neck playfully. I couldn't help it and started kissing her lips. We hugged passionately, and I felt our excitement increase more and more. <LINE> <LINE> - I feel so good with you,-  Maggie whispered in my ear. I kissed her back.",

We just stood and watched the statue move, gradually becoming alive and plastic. <LINE> <LINE> What happened next was a little unexpected. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see that the statue was talking.

There is a figure in front of me, bending over papers, but I cannot determine who it is. Suddenly she turns to me and I realize that this is my older sister.

The hall is empty, except for the old staircase leading to the second floor.

I try not to make noise, afraid to attract the attention of someone or something. <LINE> <LINE> As I continue my exploration, I find many rooms and corridors, each of which may hide new dangers. In one room I find a dead mouse, in another a flaming torch that begins to burn me as I approach it. <LINE> <LINE> Nevertheless, I keep walking, getting more and more scared, and I begin to notice some strange sounds coming from the depths of the factory. It could be footsteps, the scraping of metal, or the rustle of raincoats. I don't know what those sounds are, but they make my heart beat faster and faster. <LINE> <LINE> Finally, I find myself in a huge hall, where the remains of old equipment are located.

All around me I see broken wires, cracked walls and broken glass.

I feel uneasy, but I can't stop and start moving towards the source of the noise. <LINE> <LINE> As I get closer, the sounds grow louder and indistinct until I reach a huge room containing an old conveyor belt. The conveyor belt is still running, even though the factory has been abandoned. <LINE> <LINE> And then, from under the conveyor belt comes an ominous whisper, calling me to him. I get closer and see a pair of eyes that glow in the dark. <LINE> <LINE> - Who are you? I ask, feeling fear grip me. <LINE> <LINE> - We're all alive here, -  the voice whispers. This factory has never been empty. We are all here, hidden in the dark. <LINE> <LINE> - Who are you? I ask, not understanding what is happening. <LINE> <LINE> - My name is Jack, -  the man replies. I worked here at this factory until it was closed. But what are you doing here? This is a dangerous place, you need to get out of here. <LINE> <LINE> I explain to Jack that I happened to be in this abandoned factory and try to find my way out.

I ask. <LINE> <LINE> - This place holds a secret, -  Jack replies. - I can't tell you everything that happened here, but I'm sure you should get out of here before it's too late. <LINE> <LINE> Suddenly, we hear a sound from afar, as if someone is approaching us. I look around and see that the darkness is shrinking around us, as if we are surrounded by invisible shadows. <LINE> <LINE> - This can't be true,-  I whisper, trying to convince myself that this is just a dream. But when I turn to Jack, I notice that he has disappeared. <LINE> <LINE> I am left alone, inside an abandoned factory that seems to be getting darker and more sinister. I understand that I do not know how to get out of this nightmare, and that I have to go through many dangers and trials in order to survive.",
